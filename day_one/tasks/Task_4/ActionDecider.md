You have learned different building blocks for processing actions inside your application.

Make use of them by implementing following requirement:

- We want to log the loaded books to the browser console if we get three or less books from our API
- If we get more than three books from the api we also want to display the books count below the whole book-list


Think about the actions you might need and what kind of action deciders, transformers you should use.
